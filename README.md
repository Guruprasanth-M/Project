## 🧩 Problem Statement

In most colleges and universities, student activities, alumni connections, competitions, job/internship opportunities, and mentorship are spread across many paid or isolated platforms:

- **Coding challenges:** HackerRank, LeetCode, Codeforces
- **CTFs:** PicoCTF, HackTheBox, TryHackMe
- **Quizzes/Exams:** Google Forms, LMS
- **Project submissions:** Internal portals, GitHub
- **Jobs/Internships:** LinkedIn, Naukri, Indeed
- **Alumni connections:** WhatsApp, LinkedIn groups

This fragmentation creates problems:
- Students miss out if they can't afford premium platforms.
- Progress and achievements are hard to track across systems.
- Colleges/institutions lack a single dashboard to showcase or monitor student/alumni activity.
- Alumni-student-staff networking is weak and scattered.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Unify** all major student, alumni, and staff activities into ONE platform.
- **Make it free or low-cost** so every student and college has equal access.
- **Enable personal and career growth:** mentorship, projects, competitions, jobs, events.
- **Auto-profile building:** Showcase achievements, skills, and connections from platform activity.
- **Institution dashboard:** Let colleges track, celebrate, and leverage student/alumni success.
